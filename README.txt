This is the PSAGE library:

    http://code.google.com/p/purplesage/

The target audience of PSAGE is research mathematicians, with an
emphasis on arithmetic geometry. PSAGE is closely related to Sage, but
is aimed squarely at research mathematicians.

It contains:

    * FunctionFields -- some basic code for arithmetic with function fields

    * ELLFF -- computing L-functions of elliptic curves over function fields

    * modform:

           - rational -- some code for modular forms over the rational (GL_2)

           - hilbert -- code for hilbert modular forms

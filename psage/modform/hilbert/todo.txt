Plan to finish a first complete HMF over Q(sqrt(5)) of weight (2,2)
implementation that works and is very fast.  Goal is to finish this in
less than 24 from now!  

   [ ] P^1(O_F/N) using fast residue rings
   [ ] is_square
   [ ] sqrt
   [ ] local splitting for O_F/P^n
   [ ] Mat2x2(O_F/N) -- matrix object with optimal action on P^1(O_F/N) elts.
   [ ] 120 icosians
   [ ] Dividing P^1 into orbits for action of R^*.
   [ ] write fast version of code for hecke operator T_P for odd P
   [ ] code for hecke operator T_2 (hardcode norm 2 elts); easy once have splittings at all primes
